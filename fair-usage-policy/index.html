      Fair Usage Policy for Promptly
      Last Updated: 16/12/12024
    </p>

<h2>
    Fair Usage Policy for the Unlimited Plan
</h2>
<p>
    At Promptly, we are committed to providing an exceptional experience for all users. To maintain high-quality service and ensure fair resource distribution, we have implemented this Fair Usage Policy for our Unlimited Plan.

    While the Unlimited Plan does not impose strict usage caps, we monitor usage to identify and address excessive or unreasonable activity that may impact system performance, other users, or service sustainability.
</p>

<h2>
    1. What is Considered Fair Usage?
</h2>
<p>
    Under typical usage, Promptly users utilize the platform for personal or professional tasks that align with normal expectations for OCR and AI To-Do list generation.

    Fair usage thresholds are dynamically determined based on average usage patterns across all Unlimited Plan subscribers. Although we don’t enforce hard limits, the following approximate guidelines define reasonable usage:
    
    - OCR Usage: Up to 100,000 OCR extractions per month.
    - AI To-Do List Generation: Up to 1,000 To-Do lists per month.
    These thresholds are set significantly higher than the usage of 99% of our users.
</p>

<h2>
    2. Monitoring and Notifications
</h2>
<p>
    We monitor individual usage to ensure compliance with this policy. If we detect unusually high usage:

    1. First Notification: You will receive an email alert if your usage significantly exceeds the fair usage threshold.
    2. Follow-Up Notification: If excessive usage continues, we may reach out to discuss your needs and identify a solution, such as a custom plan tailored for your use case.
</p>

<h2>
    3. Actions for Excessive Usage
</h2>
<p>
    If usage patterns remain excessively high and unreasonable, we reserve the right to take appropriate actions, including:

    - Throttling Usage: Temporarily limiting OCR or AI To-Do list processing speed.
    - Service Suspension: Pausing your account temporarily to ensure system stability.
    - Plan Adjustment: Offering a higher-tier or custom enterprise plan to accommodate your needs.
    We will always aim to communicate transparently and resolve concerns fairly before taking any such actions.</p>

<h2>
    4. Exemptions
</h2>
<p>
    If you have a specific use case requiring significantly higher usage, please contact our support team. We’re happy to discuss and create a tailored solution for your needs.</p>
<h2>
    5. Purpose of the Fair Usage Policy
</h2>
<p>
    The Fair Usage Policy ensures that:

    - All users enjoy uninterrupted and high-quality service.
    - Resources are used responsibly to maintain system performance and stability.
    - Abuse of resources, intentional or unintentional, does not degrade the experience for others.</p>
